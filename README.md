# Rating_using_NLP_techniques
Classifying Amazon reviews based on customer ratings using NLP. Reviews provide objective feedback to a
product and are therefore inherently useful for consumers. These ratings are often summarized by a numerical
rating, or the number of stars. Of course there is more value in the actual text itself than the quantified stars.
And at times, the given rating does not truly convey the experience of the product â€“ the heart of the feedback is
actually in the text itself. The goal therefore is to build a classifier that would understand the essence of a piece
of review and assign it the most appropriate rating based on the meaning of the text.
